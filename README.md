## ü§∏ Getting Started

### üöÖ Requirements
Your server needs to meet the following minimum requirements to run Xera:
- PHP v8.2 or above.
- MySQL v5.7 or above.
- A valid, trusted SSL certificate.

Additionally, the server assumes you can use Apache's ``mod_rewrite`` to allow pretty URLs. If you do not, you'll need to replace the ``index_page`` setting in ``app/config/config.php``:
```php
$config['index_page'] = 'index.php';
```

### üíæ Installation 
The installation of Xera Enhanced is much easier than you think!
- Download the Xera Enhanced installation files [here](https://github.com/FuryCraft/Xera-enhanced/releases/latest). Alternatively, if you want the latest development version you can get it [here](https://github.com/FuryCraft/Xera-enhanced/archive/refs/heads/dev.zip).
- Extract the file and upload the contents to your web hosting account. 
- Create a new database for Xera.
- Go to ```https://{your.domain}/{xera-directory}/install.php``` and click on the 'Get Started' button.
- Set your website's ```Website URL```, ```Cookie Prefix```, enable ```CSRF Protection``` and hit the 'Next Step' button.
- Edit the database credentials and click on the 'Next Step' button (this will automatically import tables and records to the database).
- Register an admin account and login to your admin panel. 
- Replace the logo and favicon located in ```assets/default/img/``` with your own.
- Setup SMTP (see below for some services you can use).
- All done! 

### üìß SMTP
Here are some widely used SMTP services. They have free plans with some limitations, most importantly though, they are compatible with Xera.
- [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/). 
> **Note**  
> Mailgun seems to offer only a trial plan for a month, and without adding a credit card you are only authorized to send emails to 5 recipients. Therefore, you may want to choose another service.
- [Mailjet](https://mailjet.com/).
- [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/free/).
